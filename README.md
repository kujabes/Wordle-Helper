### Wordle Helper
The goal of this project is to help narrow down the search space of possible valid guesses that can be made, and is updated from previous guesses. 

This is done using a GUI with 3 main components:
  - Guess and State entry
  - Close Word Bank
  - Far Word Bank

The guess and state entry textboxes are to update the current status of the wordle game.

The close word bank shows a list of all the words which could be a possible solution.

The far word bank is a list of all words which have no character overlap with any of the previous guesses.
